# CairoSharp
CairoSharp is a C# wrapper for .NET Standard 1.6/2.0 of [cairo](https://www.cairographics.org/). All dependencies included.

Cairo is a 2D graphics library with support for multiple output devices.

Cairo is designed to produce consistent output on all output media while taking advantage of display hardware acceleration when available.
The cairo API provides operations similar to the drawing operators of PostScript and PDF.
Operations in cairo including stroking and filling cubic BÃ©zier splines, transforming and compositing translucent images, and antialiased text rendering.
All drawing operations can be transformed by any affine transformation (scale, rotation, shear, etc.).

# Platforms

[A former release](https://github.com/zwcloud/CairoSharp/releases/tag/dotnet45_v1) works on Windows desktop (Winform/WPF/Console Application) on .NET 4.5 and linux (tested on Ubuntu 12.04) on mono 4.2. CairoSharp was ported to .NET Core (.NET Standard 1.6) after that release.

Supported platforms:  

* windows 32bit / 64bit
* linux 64bit (tested on Ubuntu 16.04-server)

Other platforms that support .net core may work, but have not been tested.

On Linux _libcairo_ is a prerequisite. `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y libcairo2`

# Build

## Windows

### Build native dlls
 We use VS2019 to build native libraries as dll files.

* Preparation:

	1. Open Visual Studio Installer, click `Modify` or `More/Modify`;
	2. Check __Desktop development with C++__;
	3. In the __Summary__ section on the right, open __Desktop development with C++__, then check __Windows 8.1 SDK and UCRT SDK__.
	4. Click `Modify` button.

* Build
	
	1. Open CarioSharp.sln with VS2019.
	2. Select a configuration: `Debug` or `Release`, and a platform: `x86` or `x64`. For `AnyCPU`, be sure to set/unset [Prefer 32-bit](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13149905/any-cpu-prefer-32-bit) to use the same architecture as the native dll.
	3. Find the project `source/native/cairo`, right click and select `Build`.
	4. Built native dll files will be output to `source/native/cairo/bin/`.

#### Build C# projects

* Build CairoSharp

	In VS2019, right click the CairoSharp project then select `Build`. CairoSharp.dll and its native dependencies will be placed in the output dir such as `source\CairoSharp\bin\Debug\netstandard2.0`.

* Build C# demos

	In VS2019, right click a C# demo project then select `Build`. The built demo app, CairoSharp.dll and native dependencies will be placed in the output dir such as `demos\CairoDemo\bin\Debug\netcoreapp2.0`.

**Common Errors:**

> Error C1083 Cannot open include file: 'assert.h': No such file or directory

Make sure `Windows 8.1 SDK and UCRT SDK` is checked (See _Preparation 3_ above). See also [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/48483877/3427520).
